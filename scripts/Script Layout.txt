--- Script Layout ---
A quick explination of the layout I hope everyone will follow for scriptdev2.

--- Folders ---
Area - Contains scripts used solely by area triggers

Boss - Boss scripts

Creature - Individual and Generic Creature scripts

Custom - Intentionally empty folder from SVN. If you make a custom script please put it here.

GO - Contains scripts used solely by Game Objects (GOs)

Guard - Scripts for Guard NPCs

Honor - Honor npcs (currently a blank script as these npcs do nothing special)

Item - Item scripts

NPC - Scripts for individual NPCs such as Marshal Mcbride

Servers - Generic NPC servers script for things such as flightmasters and guildmasters.

--- Naming Conventions ---

Please keep file names to "sc_objectname.cpp" where objectname is replaced by the name of the object, creature, item, or area that this script will be used by.
