--- How to install ScriptDev2 ---

1) Create a new folder under "src\bindings\" called "ScriptDev2"
2) Checkout the ScriptDev2 trunk from "http://scriptdev2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scriptdev2/"
3) Compile MaNGOS!

4a) On Win32: Compile ScriptDev2 using the VC71 or VC80 project within the ScriptDev2 folder (this will overwrite the Mangoscript dll in the output directory)

4b) On Linux: You will need to use the makefile.am provided with ScriptDev2 and figure out the rest on your own. Hopefully we'll get better support for linux as we go.

5) Execute the included "scripts.sql"
6) Run mangosd from your output directory
