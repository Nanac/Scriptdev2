--- How to install ScriptDev2 ---

1) Download MaNGOS
2) Create a new folder under "src\bindings\" within the MaNGOS source called "ScriptDev2"
3) Checkout the ScriptDev2 trunk from "https://scriptdev2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scriptdev2"

4a) On Win32:
 - Compile MaNGOS
 - Compile ScriptDev2 using the VC71 or VC80 project within the ScriptDev2 folder (this will overwrite the Mangoscript dll in the output directory)

4b) On Linux:
- Apply MaNGOS-r3460-ScriptDev2.patch to Mangos Source
- Compile MaNGOS (ScriptDev2 will automatically be built when compiling Mangos from here on)

5a) Execute the included "scriptdev_full.sql"
5b) Execute the included "scriptdev_additional_req.sql"

6) Run mangosd from your output directory


To update all you have to do is open src\bindings\ and right click on the ScriptDev2 folder and click "Update" and then rebuild. Much simpler than before.

To update your Database with new Scriptdev2 SQL changes you can either a) apply only the changes that were made during that revision by looking in the sql\update folder or b ) reapply "scriptdev_full.sql" to your database. You should run "scriptdev_additional_req.sql" after any database update.
