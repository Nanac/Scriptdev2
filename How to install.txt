--- How to install ScriptDev2 ---

1) Download MaNGOS
2) Create a new folder under "src\bindings\" within the MaNGOS source called "ScriptDev2"
3) Checkout the ScriptDev2 trunk from "https://scriptdev2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scriptdev2"

4a) On Win32: 
 - Compile MaNGOS
 - Compile ScriptDev2 using the ScriptVC70 or ScriptVC80 Solution within the ScriptDev2 folder (this will overwrite the Mangoscript dll in the output directory)

4b) On Linux: 
- Apply MaNGOS-rXXXX-ScriptDev2.patch, where XXXX is the highest version to that of your MaNGOS revision, to Mangos Source
- Compile MaNGOS (ScriptDev2 will automatically be built when compiling Mangos from here on)

5a) Execute the included "scriptdev_full.sql"
5b) Execute the included "scriptdev_additional_req.sql"

6) Run mangosd from your output directory


To update all you have to do is open src\bindings\ and right click on the ScriptDev2 folder and click "Update" and then follow steps 4 - 6 again. You must still compile MaNGOS before ScriptDev2 when on the Windows platform.

To update your Database with new Scriptdev2 SQL changes you can either a) apply only the changes that were made during that revision by looking in the sql\update folder or b ) reapply "scriptdev_full.sql" to your database. You should run "scriptdev_additional_req.sql" after any database update.

I only have Visual Studio 2005 installed on my computer so the Visual Studio 2003 settings might be a little off and I currently don't have a clue as to how to create Linux make files so if anyone wants to help please post here.
