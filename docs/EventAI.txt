Event AI documentation
=========================================

Scriptdev2 Revision 220 introduces a new database defined AI named EventAI.
This system allows users to create new creature scripts entierly within the Database.
ScriptName must still be set to "mob_eventai" within the MaNGOS database creature_template.scriptname field.

-----------------------------------------
Basic Structure of EventAI
-----------------------------------------
Event AI follows a basic if (Event) then do {Action} format.
Below is a the list of current fields within the Eventai_scripts table.

(Field_Name                 Discription)
id                          This value is mearly an incrementing counter of the current Event number. Required for sql queries.
creature_id                 Creature id which this event should occur on.

event_type                  Type of event (See Event Types below)
event_inverse_phase_mask    Mask which phases this event should NOT trigger in*
event_param1                Variable for event (dependant on Event type)
event_param2
event_param3

action1_type                First Type of Action to take when event occurs (See Action Types below)
action1_param1              Variables used for Action1 (dependant on Action type)
action1_param2
action1_param3

action2_type                Second Type of Action to take when event occurs (See Action Types below)
action2_param1              Variables used for Action2 (dependant on Action type)
action2_param2
action2_param3

action3_type                Third Type of Action to take when event occurs (See Action Types below)
action3_param1              Variables used for Action3 (dependant on Action type)
action3_param2
action3_param3

All params are signed 32 bit values (+/- 2147483647). If param specifies time then time is in milliseconds. If param specifies percentage then percentages are value/100 (ex: if param = 500 then that means 500%, -50 = -50%)

*Phase mask is a bit mask of which phases this event should not trigger in. Example: Phase mask value of 12 (1100) would mean that this event would trigger 0, 1 and all other phases except for 2 and 3 (0 counts as the first phase). 
-----------------------------------------
Event Types
-----------------------------------------
Below is the list of current Event types that EventAI can handle.
Each event type has its own specific interpretation of the params that accompany it.
Params are always read from Param1, then Param2, then Param3.

(#   Internal Name               Pamarm usage                           Discription)
0    EVENT_T_TIMER_REPEAT        Time, Initial, Random                  Expires first at (Param2) and then every (Param1 + rand()%Param3) time. If (Param3) is negative it specifices chance of event occuring.
1    EVENT_T_TIMER_SINGLE        Time, Chance%                          Expires once every (Param1) per Reset with (Param2) chance of occuring.
2    EVENT_T_TIMER_OOC_REPEAT    Time, Initial, Random                  Expires first at (Param2) and then every (Param1 + rand()%Param3) time while not in combat. If (Param3) is negative it specifies chance of event occuring.
3    EVENT_T_TIMER_OOC_SINGLE    Time, Chance%                          Expires once every (Param1) while not in combat per Reset with (Param2) chance of occuring.
4    EVENT_T_HP_SINGLE           HPMax%, HPMin%, TimeUntilRepeat        Expires when HP is between (Param1) and (Param2). Will repeat every (Param3) or never repeat if Param3 = 0. If Param3 is negative it specifies chance of event occuring.
5    EVENT_T_MANA_SINGLE         ManaMax%,ManaMin% TimeUntilRepeat      Expires once Mana% is between (Param1) and (Param2). Will repeat every (Param3) or never repeat if Param3 = 0. If Param3 is negative it specifies chance of event occuring.
6    EVENT_T_AGGRO               Chance%                                Expires upon initial aggro (does not repeat). Has (Param1) chance of occuring.
7    EVENT_T_KILL                TimeUntilRepeat, Chance%               Expires upon killing a player. Will always occur unless (Param1) is not 0 in which case will only occur every (Param1) milliseconds. Has (Param2) chance of occuring.
8    EVENT_T_DEATH               Chance%                                Expires upon Death. Has (Param1) chance of occuring.
9    EVENT_T_EVADE               Chance%                                Expires upon creature EnterEvadeMode(). Has (Param1) chance of occuring.
10   EVENT_T_SPELLHIT            SpellID, TimeUntilRepeat, Chance%      Expires upon Spell hit. If (param1) is set will only expire on that spell. Will repeat every (Param2) or never repeat if Param2 = 0. Has (Param3) chance of occuring.

Action Types
-----------------------------------------
Below is the list of current Action types that EventAI can handle.
Each event type has its own specific interpretation of the params that accompany it.
Params are always read from Param1, then Param2, then Param3.

19   ACTION_T_REMOVE_UNIT_FLAG         Flags, Target                   Removes flag (flags can be binary OR together to modify multiple flags at once) on for Target type (param2)
20   ACTION_T_AUTO_ATTACK              AllowAutoAttack                 0 = stop melee attack, anything else means continue attacking/allow melee attacking
21   ACTION_T_COMBAT_MOVEMENT          AllowCombatMovement             0 = stop combat based movement, anything else continue/allow combat based movement (targeted movement generator)
22   ACTION_T_SET_PHASE                Phase                           Sets the current phase to (param1)

24   ACTION_T_EVADE                    No Params                       Forces the creature to evade. Wiping all threat and dropping combat.
25   ACTION_T_FLEE                     No Params                       Causes the creature to flee. Please use this action instead of directly casting this spell so we may change this when a more correct approach is found.
26   ACTION_T_QUEST_COMPLETE_ALL       QuestId                         Completes quest (param1) for all players on the threat list
27   ACTION_T_CASTCREATUREGO_ALL       QuestId, SpellId                Calls CastedCreatureOrGo for all players on the threat list with QuestID(Param1) and SpellId(Param2)

* = Use -1 to specify that if this param is picked to do nothing. Random is constant between actions within an event. So if you have a random Yell and a random Sound they will match up (ex: param2 with param2)
-----------------------------------------
Target Types
-----------------------------------------
Below is the list of current Target types that EventAI can handle.
Target types are used by certain actions and may effect actions differently

(#   Internal Name                      Discription)
0    TARGET_T_SELF                      Self cast
1    TARGET_T_HOSTILE                   Our current target (ie: highest aggro)
2    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_SECOND_AGGRO      Second highest aggro (generaly used for cleaves and some special attacks)
3    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_LAST_AGGRO        Dead last on aggro (no idea what this could be used for)
4    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_RANDOM            Just any random target on our threat list
5    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_RANDOM_NOT_TOP    Any random target except top threat

-----------------------------------------
Cast Flags
-----------------------------------------
Below is the list of current Cast Flags that EventAI's spell casting can handle.
Cast flags are handled bitwise. Bit 0 is Interrupt Previous, bit 1 is triggered, etc.
So for example the number "3"(11 in binary) would mean that this cast should both interrupt previous and triggered spell.

(bit#   Internal Name                  Discription)
0       CAST_INTURRUPT_PREVIOUS        Interrupts any previous spell casting (basicaly makes sure that this spell goes off)
1       CAST_TRIGGERED                 Forces the spell to be instant cast and require no mana/reagents.
