--- TO DO ---
Simple list of things we need to do.

--- ScriptDev2 Framework ---

- Rewrite simple scripts to use SimpleAI class instead of their current defined class which wastes resources and compile time. 

--- Scripting with Priorities ---
1) Boss AI scripts
2) Specific NPC scripts
3) Event scripts
4) Spell and Item scripts

--- Core Problems ---

- Unable to write new movement generators (you shouldn't need to though)
- Spell scripts are only controllable by the core
- Events/EventScripts are only controllable by the core
