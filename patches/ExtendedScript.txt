--- Extended Script ---
Extended script is a patch for the mangos core which allows scripts to react to emotes and to get detailed spell data.

It is NOT required and is NOT installed by default. You can use scriptdev2 without the need for Extended Script. All it does is provide extra features.

--- Install ---

1) Patch your Mangos core with "ExtendedScript.patch"
2) Recomple Mangos
3) Recompile ScriptDev2

--- After install ---
If you decide you no longer want to use ExtendedScript you can avoid having to revert your files by simply removing the line

#define SCRIPT_EXTENDED
